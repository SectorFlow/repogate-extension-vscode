# RepoGate

**Stay compliant. Keep coding.**

RepoGate automatically checks your dependencies against your organization's security policies—so you know if a package is approved *before* you commit your code.

## Why RepoGate?

✅ **Know before you commit** - Get instant feedback on package approvals  
✅ **Save time** - No waiting for security reviews after the fact  
✅ **Stay compliant** - Meet your organization's security requirements automatically  
✅ **Keep developing** - Non-blocking notifications that don't interrupt your flow
